# KnoxRestaurants

This Ruby gem parses Yelp API to gather information about restaurants in Knoxville, Tennessee. It uses user input to prompt different displays of information for restaurants based on a numbered item list of cuisines. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Knox_Restaurants'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Knox_Restaurants

## Usage

To start the program, run 'bin/knox_restaurants' in terminal. There will be a numbered list of cuisines to choose from. There will be a prompt to enter in a number. It will return a list of restaurants corresponding to the user's input. From here, enter a valid number to get more information for that restaurant. Enter "end" to exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
